# Test threshold audit log

Every numeric threshold (tolerance, bounds, RMS, timing) in the test suite must
have a physical or mathematical derivation. A threshold without a reason is a
threshold that might have been fitted to a broken implementation — the iDEATH
project considers fitting-to-impl the single most dangerous TDD anti-pattern
(see `CLAUDE.md` → "Threshold justification" + "TDD is non-negotiable" memory).

This file records the per-file audit status and a compressed summary of each
file's key derivations. The full derivations live as adjacent comments in the
test source; this file is the navigable index you consult when a test fails
with an unexpected delta and you need to know "where did that 5% come from?"

## Per-file audit summary

Review cadence: one file at a time. A file is marked audited only after every
threshold in it has a stated derivation (formula, physical identity, spec
value, or ULP argument). When a new primitive is added, its test file starts
life in this index as unaudited and is added to the table once the derivation
pass is done.

| `test_Oscillator` | zero-crossing range [836, 924] = 2 crossings/cycle × 440 Hz ± 5% |
| `test_Wavetable` | 4-bit normalization values; frequency correctness margins |
